"Aim- to prepare tin iodide and examine the reactivity by carrying out 3 different tests. Procedure- tin metal(1g) was transferred to a Quickfit round bottom flask and iodine(2.55g) was added. Toluene(10cm3) and anti-bumping granules were added as well. The flask was attached to a reflux condenser and then heated until the condensing solvent was clear. The solution was transferred to a conical flask, petroleum spirit 40-60 was added and then cooled in an ice bath for 5 minutes. The residual tin was left in the reaction flask, washed out with acetone, dried and then weighed (0.42g). The crystals in the conical flask were filtered off and washed with petroleum spirit 40-60 then weighed(1.9g). Tests- a spatula of the crystals was dissolved in water(20ml) Test 1- the solution (2ml) was transferred to a test tube and 0.1mL silver nitrate was added (5 drops) and shaken for 30 seconds. Test 2- in a fume cupboard the solution(2mL) was transferred to a test tube and the end of a hot copper wire was put in the solution, the wire was heated again by a Bunsen.", 0.85
"The aim of this experiment was to create SnI4 from the reaction between elemental tin and iodine and then to assess its properties by carrying out three tests. 1.0g of tin was added to a 100ml round bottom along with approximately 2.5g of iodine weighed accurately on a watch glass, which should then be added to the flask with a powder funnel. 10cm3 of toluene should be added to the flask along with some anti-bumping granules. The round bottom flask should then be heated under reflux with a heating mantle until the purple vapor turns clear and the solution has turned purple.

Orange crystals should begin to form which once fully recrystallized should be separated from the solution using a Buchner funnel. A heaped microspatula of the crystal should be dissolved in 15ml of water and the pH should be checked.

Tin (IV) iodide was produced by reacting 1g of tin metal with 2.5g of iodine. To isolate the tin (IV) iodide the products of the tin iodine reaction were dissolved in 10cm3 of toluene, an ideal solvent since tin (IV) iodide is highly soluble in non-polar solvents, and this solution was heated-under reflux (using anti-bumping granules to control heating) causing the mixture to condense. tin (IV) iodide is highly soluble in non-polar solvents therefore 10cm3 of toluene was used as a solvent to produce a solution which could be heated-under reflux causing the mixture to condense. To isolate  the tin (IV) iodide, the solution obtained from condensation was transferred to a conical flask and left to cooled in an ice bath, this promoted crystallisation.
